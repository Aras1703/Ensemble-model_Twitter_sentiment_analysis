in this case, There are some library that used from Scikit - Learn and TensorFlow for preprocess the data and build the model like TF-IDF for Weighting the text, Embedding Layer for represent the vector that contain a word from text data, and i use a several algorithm like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, LSTM etc. Result prove that SVM with Hyperparameter Tuning get a best accuracy with 89 % accuracy, second model that had a good accuracy is random forest with 88 % accuracy, following by other machine learning model like LSTM with 85 % accuracy, Naive Bayes with 83 % accuracy, and Neural network with 81 % accuracy.
